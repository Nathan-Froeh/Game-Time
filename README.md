# Family Feud!

We all remember the quirky TV show, that puts two families head to head in a trivia-like stand off. Now you can play from the comfort of your own computer. A question is displayed on the screen and each player will have an opportunity to make a guess as to what the top three survey responses are until the board is full. In the first two rounds, players alternate making guesses, but in the Fast Money round, each player will have 30 seconds to give as many guesses as possible as well as up the ante by adding a multiplier to their score.
